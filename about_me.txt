Hi! I am Md Nahiyan Uddin. I have received my B.Sc.Engg. in Computer Science and Engineering from
          <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology
            (BUET)</a>
          and am currently working as a Lecturer
          (<a href="https://cse.uap-bd.edu/faculty/faculty_details/10">my profile</a>)
          at the
          <a href="https://www.uap-bd.edu/">University of Asia Pacific</a>.
          I am also conducting my research work under Professor
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abmalimalislam/home" target="_blank">Dr. A. B. M. Alim Al Islam</a>
          and Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mahmudanaznin" target="_blank">Dr. Mahmuda Naznin</a> from BUET.
          Currently, I am doing two research works on Rohingya Refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, and one of them is a collaborative work with
          the
          Department of Software Systems & Cybersecurity, Monash University, Australia.
          I completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Professor
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abmalimalislam/home" target="_blank">Dr. A. B. M. Alim Al Islam</a>
          on applying machine learning on brainwaves collected from EEG sensors. My research interests include
          artificial intelligence,
          machine learning and it's applications,
          wearable and implantable systems,
          IoT,
          Human-Computer Interaction,
          Data Mining,
          Computer Vision,
          Natural Language Processing, and
          Robotics.
          I love to explore different algorithms of Machine Learning and apply my knowledge to find optimal
          solutions of state of the art problems.
